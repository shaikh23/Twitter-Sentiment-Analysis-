I would like to analyze twitter data to see how people feel about certain political candidates in the current presidential election, going back to the 
past two years.
I would use natural language processing to analyze positive/negative words and logistic regression/random forests to classify words into certain groups. 
The data would be obtained from a twitter api. This project would utilize a narrative format via jupyter notebooks along with a set of slides to give 
additional information.


I would like to take my initial capstone project and further develop it into a multiple linear regression problem. 
Initially, I looked at how height/bmi affect yards gained and touchdowns scored, but now I would like to include other features, location/time of day/altitude etc.,
to see if it is possible to predict the outcome of an nfl game.I would add to the data that I already have by using the nfl api, and scrape pro-football-reference again.
This project would utilize a narrative format via jupyter notebooks along with a set of slides to give additional information.


I would like to try to predict overall coronavirus cases and deaths based upon several features such as gender, class, race etc..
The primary model utilized here would be linear regression along with knn and random forests. The data would be gathered from the CDC through their api.
This project would utilize a narrative format via jupyter notebooks along with a set of slides to give additional information.
